This includes setting up auth and profile microservices (names must start with 'flock'), their respective PostgreSQL databases, a Temporal workflow service backed by ScyllaDB, and implementing the User Registration Workflow. Authentication is username-based rather than email-based. The Register RPC will execute synchronously using a Temporal workflow to ensure atomicity across user and profile creation with compensation handling.",
