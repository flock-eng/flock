# Follow the Rules

## Context
Need to establish consistent practices across the codebase and maintain high-quality standards through automated guidance.

## Solution
Implement and follow cursor rules for various aspects of development. The rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` and provide automated guidance for:
- Code organization and structure
- Documentation management
- Best practices enforcement
- Adaptive learning from past solutions

Key rules implemented:
- `adaptive-learning.mdc`: Manages knowledge base of solutions
- `cursor-rules-guidance.mdc`: Provides rule creation standards
- `cursor-rule-locations.mdc`: Enforces rule file organization
- `documentation-management.mdc`: Guides documentation structure

## Benefits
- Consistent code quality across the project
- Automated enforcement of best practices
- Reduced technical debt through standardization
- Knowledge preservation and reuse
- Clear documentation structure
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## Considerations
- Rules should be regularly reviewed and updated
- Balance between strictness and flexibility
- Rules should evolve with the project
- Consider creating new rules when patterns emerge
- Follow semantic versioning for rule updates
