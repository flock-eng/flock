      When adding a new solution or learning:

      1. Create a markdown file in `.cursor/solutions/` with a descriptive name
      2. Use the following template structure:
         ```markdown
         # Solution Title

         ## Context
         Brief description of the problem or challenge that was solved

         ## Solution
         Detailed explanation of the implemented solution

         ## Benefits
         List of benefits and improvements achieved

         ## Considerations
         Any important considerations, trade-offs, or limitations

         ## Tags

         - Related PRs: [Optional]
         ```

      3. Tag the solution appropriately for future reference
      4. Include any relevant code snippets or architecture diagrams
      5. Document the context and reasoning behind the solution
