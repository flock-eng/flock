      When working with any files in this project:

      1. **Cursor Rules Management**:
         - When creating or updating cursor rules:
           - Follow location standards in `.cursor/rules/`
           - Specifically, consider `.cursor/rules/cursor-rule-evolution.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-guidance.mdc`, and `.cursor/rules/cursor-rule-locations.mdc`
           - Use proper rule structure and sections
           - Consider rule evolution triggers
           - Document changes in evolution history
         - Reference existing cursor rules for patterns
         - Maintain consistent rule versioning

      2. **General Guidelines**:
         This section will expand to include:
         - Project-wide conventions
         - Common patterns

         - Cross-cutting concerns
