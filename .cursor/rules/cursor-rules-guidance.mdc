# Cursor Rules Guidance

This file explains how to create and structure Cursor rule files. It describes the purpose of each section in a rule file and provides an example to guide your implementation.

      When writing a Cursor rule, organize your file into distinct sections:

      1. **YAML Front Matter**:
         - **Purpose**: Provides metadata about the rule file (e.g., description and file matching patterns).
         - **Format**:
           ```
           ---
           description: Brief description of the rule's purpose
           globs: *.mdc
           ---
           ```
         - **Notes**: Do NOT wrap the globs with a parentheses like "*.mdc". Instead, list it without parentheses like *.mdc.

      2. **Markdown Header**:
         - **Purpose**: Titles the file for easy identification.
         - **Format**:
           ```
           # Cursor Rules Guidance
           This sections highlights the purpose of the rule
           ```

      3. **Rule Block (<rule> ... </rule>)**:
         - **Purpose**: Encapsulates the rule's definition.
         - **Key Sections**:
           - **name**: A unique identifier for the rule. (rule name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens)
           - **description**: A summary of the rule's purpose.
           - **filters**: Conditions to select applicable files or events (e.g., matching `.mdc` files).
           - **actions**: Steps to take when filters match (such as `reject` or `suggest`), with associated messages or conditions.
           - **examples**: Illustrative input/output examples that show proper rule usage.
           - **metadata**: Additional attributes such as rule priority and version.

      4. **Example YAML Structure**:
         This is an example structure for a Cursor rule represented using a YAML-like format:
         ```
         name: example-rule
         description: A sample rule demonstrating proper structure
         filters:
           - type: file_extension
             pattern: "\\.mdc$"
         actions:
           - type: reject
             conditions:
               - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
                 message: "Rule files must be placed in the .cursor/rules directory"
         examples:
           - input: |
               incorrect/path.mdc
             output: "Error: Rule file is not in the correct directory"
           - input: |
               .cursor/rules/example-rule.mdc
             output: "Rule file is correctly placed"
         metadata:
           priority: high
           version: 1.0.0
         ```

      Follow these guidelines to ensure all your Cursor rule files are well-organized, clear, and consistent.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Poorly structured rule file example
      rule-example.mdc
      (missing YAML front matter and structured <rule> block)
    output: "The rule file is missing required sections."
  - input: |

      name: sample-rule
      description: A sample rule file following the guidelines.
      ...
      </rule>
    output: "The rule file is structured correctly."

      type: "update"

</rule>

NOTE: Please provide the glob pattern exactly as *.mdc. Do not wrap it in parentheses (e.g., (*.mdc) is not valid).
